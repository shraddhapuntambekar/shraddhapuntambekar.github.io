My research spans multi-omics analysis, systems biology, mathematical modeling and machine learning with a strong focus on understanding disease mechanisms and identifying potential therapeutic biomarkers. 

## Genome-wide distribution of GATA3 and its role in breast cancer
Currently, as a Project Scientist II at CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, I initiated and developed research projects to investigate the role of GATA3 in breast cancer. I leveraged ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and regulatory gene network analysis to understand differential binding and signaling of GATA3 in luminal breast cancer. 

## Translational research
Previously, I led a fully remote team at [NonExomics](https://nonexomics.com/), an early-stage biotech startup, to deliver an on-time analysis of proprietary WGS and RNA-seq data. Our work contributed to the identification and experimental validation of novel cancer biomarkers.

## Pan-cancer analysis of novel transcripts and their potential biological functions 
Before that, during my postdoctoral research at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (IISER-Pune), I developed a proteogenomic pipeline to explore the role of non-canonical peptides in different systems. In one project, I conducted a pan-cancer analysis of publicly available RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets, characterizing novel peptides and assessing their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. This included functional annotation, structure prediction, disease-associated mutation mapping, and in-silico drug screening.

## Comparative transciptomics of two cichlid fishes
	In another project, I evaluated state-of-the-art RNA-seq tools and developed an optimized comparative transcriptomics pipeline for cichlid fish species, shedding light on the emergence of protein-coding genes from noncoding regions and their role in speciation.

## Understanding human skin depigmentation
During my Ph.D. at [CSIR-National Chemical Laboatory](https://sites.google.com/site/biosystemsanalysis/Home), I collaborated closely with three experimental labs, serving as the primary bioinformatics lead. I developed computational workflows, analyzed high-throughput data, and built mathematical models to study human skin pigmentation.

I leveraged server-based computing, and AWS cloud computing services and extensively used R, Bash, and Python for data analysis, visualization, and workflow automation.
