I am a Bioinformatics Scientist specializing in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis and systems biology. I have worked extensively in interdisciplinary environments, integrating multi-omics data, biological network-based approaches, and mathematical modeling to elucidate disease mechanisms and identify drug targets. 

My expertise lies in designing and implementing end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis (including bulk RNAseq, WGS, ChIPseq, small RNAseq and ATACseq) across multiple projects. I leveraged server-based computing, and AWS cloud computing services and extensively used R, Bash, and Python for data analysis, visualization, and workflow automation.

Currently, as a Project Scientist II at CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, I initiated and developed research projects to investigate the role of GATA3 in breast cancer. I leveraged ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and regulatory gene network analysis to understand differential binding and signaling of GATA3 in luminal breast cancer. 

Previously, I led a fully remote team at [NonExomics](https://nonexomics.com/), an early-stage biotech startup, to deliver an on-time analysis of proprietary WGS and RNA-seq data. Our work contributed to the identification and experimental validation of novel cancer biomarkers.

Before that, during my postdoctoral research at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune (IISER-Pune), I developed a proteogenomic pipeline to explore the role of non-canonical peptides in different systems. In one project, I conducted a pan-cancer analysis of publicly available RNA-seq and Ribo-seq datasets, characterizing novel peptides and assessing their potential as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. This included functional annotation, structure prediction, disease-associated mutation mapping, and in-silico drug screening.
	In another project, I evaluated state-of-the-art RNA-seq tools and developed an optimized comparative transcriptomics pipeline for cichlid fish species, shedding light on the emergence of protein-coding genes from noncoding regions and their role in speciation.

During my Ph.D. at [CSIR-National Chemical Laboatory](https://sites.google.com/site/biosystemsanalysis/Home), I collaborated closely with three experimental labs, serving as the primary bioinformatics lead. I developed computational workflows, analyzed high-throughput data, and built mathematical models to study human skin pigmentation.

I am passionate about applying my expertise to elucidate disease mechanisms and drive translational research.
