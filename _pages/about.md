I am a Bioinformatics Scientist specializing in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis and Systems Biology. I have worked extensively in interdisciplinary environments, integrating multi-omics data analysis, biological network-based approaches, mathematical modeling and machine learning to gain insights into cellular processes and disease mechanisms. 

My expertise lies in designing and implementing end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines for NGS data analysis (including bulk RNAseq, WGS, ChIPseq, small RNAseq and ATACseq) across multiple projects. 

I am passionate about applying my expertise to elucidate disease mechanisms and drive translational research.
