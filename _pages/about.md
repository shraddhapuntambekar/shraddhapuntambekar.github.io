I am a Bioinformatics Scientist specializing in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis and Systems Biology. I have leveraged multi-omics data analysis, biological network-based approaches, mathematical modeling and machine learning to gain insights into disease mechanisms and identify drug biomarkers. 

My expertise includes designing and implementing end-to-end bioinformatics pipelines for bulk RNAseq, WGS, ChIPseq, small RNAseq and ATACseq across multiple projects in inter-disciplinary environments. I have an experience in reconstructing signalling networks, and developing Boolean and ODE-based mathematical models to simulate biological systems.
